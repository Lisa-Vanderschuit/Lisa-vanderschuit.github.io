	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>From when I was really young, I have always been fascinated in the design of things where it be for practical or aesthetic purposes. I had the opportunity to be part of science clubs where I could find out how things worked and part of art classes where I was able to explore different media. I was able to develop both these sides of my interests into my strengths giving me the ability to bridge the gap between creativity and logic.</p>
	<p>Harold from Harold and the purple crayon has been one of my biggest inspirations when it comes to design.  Like Harold, designers also help to shape the environment around them.  The lesson that I learned from him was that we are only limited by our own imagination.  </p>
	<p>I'm finishing up my last year at <a href="http://www.algonquincollege.com/">Algonquin College</a>, graduating with an Advanced Diploma in Graphic Design, a 3-year program. While in school, I have had the opportunity to work with several non-profit organizations to produce set designs, presentations, branding, and promotional materials.</p>
