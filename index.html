	<h2>Bio</h2>
	<p>From when I was young, I have always been fascinated in the design of things where it be for practical or aesthetic purposes. I had the opportunity to be part of science clubs where I could find out how things worked and part of art classes where I was able to explore different media. I was able to develop both these sides of my interests into my strengths giving me the ability to bridge the gap between creativity and logic.</p>
	<p>I am an Engineering Program Manager who manages the engineering theme of Code Quality. I have been at Shopify for 6 years, working on areas from editing and reviewing Online Store themes to helping our engineering teams raise the bar of code quality at Shopify.</p>
	<p>Prior to working at Shopify I completed an advanced deploma for Graphic Design from Algonquin College.
