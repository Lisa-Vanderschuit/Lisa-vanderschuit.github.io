		<h2>Freelance Graphic Designer</h2>
			<p>Welcome to my website. I'm finishing up my last year at Algonquin College, graduating with an Advanced Diploma in Graphic Design, a 3-year program. While in school, I have had the opportunity to work with several non-profit organizations to produce set designs, presentations, branding, and promotional materials. I have just finished my graphic design related placement and will be looking for a full time position for when I graduate.</p>

				<p><strong>SPRING 2014:</strong> For six weeks, I did some fieldwork where I worked mainly on responsive website layouts.  </p>
				<p><strong>SUMMER 2013:</strong> This past summer helped with some promotional material including some logo work and poster layouts.  </p>
				<p><strong>NOVEMBER 2012:</strong> I took and edited photographs for a digital gallery of a private art collection. Each painting had to be taken off the wall and photographed individually. After the photographs were uploaded on a computer, I edited them in Photoshop to remove dust spots and reflections. For some of them, the colour had to be adusted so the digital versions had a closer colour match to the originals. </p>
				<p><strong>SUMMER 2012:</strong> I was the Creative Art Director for a non-profit summer daycamp at Arlington Woods Free Methodist Church where I had to plan out every step of the process, keep production costs low, and direct a group of people in the design of the set and decor for the camp. I was one of the photographers, and at the end of the week, I made a camp DVD for the families to take home.</p>
